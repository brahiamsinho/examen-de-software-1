# Decisions Log

## 2026-08-31 — Scope pivot to the real exam spec + stack corrections + dual-mobile clarification + SDD adoption

- **Scope pivot: the real project is the CASE-tool exam spec, not the
  originally-scaffolded generic CRUD app.** `product-04-next-django.md`
  (repo root) was found to be the actual, authoritative exam statement — an
  offline-first collaborative CASE tool for UML class diagramming with
  manual/voice/image/XMI input converging into a `CanonicalUmlModel`,
  realtime collaboration, and automatic generation of a Spring Boot
  backend + Next.js frontend + Android (Capacitor) app from the modeled
  domain. The previously scaffolded Django+DRF/Next.js/Flutter CRUD
  skeleton was infrastructure only and never described this real scope.
  `docs/ai/*` is being reconciled to describe the real target, while
  `product-04-next-django.md` itself stays frozen as the authoritative
  source (per its own section 1) and is never edited to reflect progress.
- **Stack corrections applied** (in progress by parallel workstreams at
  the time of this entry, not yet fully confirmed — see
  `CURRENT_STATE.md`): backend moves from Django REST Framework to
  **Django Ninja**; adds **Django Channels + Daphne** (ASGI) for realtime;
  adds **Argon2** password hashing + **PyJWT**; bootstraps
  **pytest + pytest-django + hypothesis**. Frontend adds
  **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Cytoscape.js + cytoscape-fcose + Jotai**;
  bootstraps **Vitest + React Testing Library**. Cypress (E2E) bootstrap is
  planned but not yet started by anyone.
- **Dual mobile requirement clarified — both mandatory, not conflicting.**
  The document's own generated-output Android strategy (section 26) is
  **Next.js PWA + Capacitor**, wrapping the same generated Next.js code —
  this applies only to applications the tool generates for its end users.
  Separately, the course instructor explicitly and firmly requires this
  project itself to ship a real **Flutter** mobile client (`mobile/`) for
  the main CASE tool. These are two independent requirements from two
  independent sources; neither supersedes or replaces the other, and both
  must be satisfied.
- **Adopted SDD (Spec-Driven Development) going forward, hybrid mode:
  OpenSpec files + Engram.** The spec document's own section 1 mandates
  deriving use cases, grouping them into cycles, proposing acceptance
  criteria, implementing one use case at a time, and maintaining a
  document of real state separate from the vision document — this is
  effectively an SDD-shaped requirement written directly into the exam
  statement. `openspec/` was initialized at the repo root (`sdd-init`) to
  formalize this: every future feature (starting with `CanonicalUmlModel`
  + `ProjectDocument`/`DiagramLayout` + the validation engine) goes through
  explore → propose → spec → design → tasks → apply → verify → archive,
  with Engram persisting cross-session decisions and context.

## Original scaffold decisions

- **Django settings package named `config`** — keeps the settings/urls/wsgi/asgi
  package name generic and decoupled from any specific app or product name.
- **Env vars via django-environ, no hardcoding** — secrets, hosts, DB
  credentials, and CORS origins must never be committed or baked into code;
  `environ.Env` centralizes reading them with sane `.env` file support.
- **psycopg2-binary over psycopg3** — chosen for tutorial/documentation
  ubiquity: most Django docs, tutorials, and Stack Overflow answers still
  assume psycopg2, and the binary wheel avoids build-toolchain friction in
  the Docker image.
- **CORS via django-cors-headers** — the Next.js frontend is a separate
  origin from the Django API, so cross-origin requests need to be
  explicitly allow-listed rather than silently blocked or wide open.
- **Tailwind intentionally NOT added** — it was not requested by the spec;
  adding it now would be an unnecessary dependency/opinion for a bare
  scaffold.
- **Flutter not dockerized** — mobile apps are built/run via the Flutter
  SDK against emulators/physical devices on the host, not inside a Linux
  container; there is no meaningful way to "run" a mobile app in a
  server-style container.
- **Multi-stage Dockerfiles with dev/prod targets (backend + frontend)** —
  a single Dockerfile serves both live-reload local development (bind
  mounts, dev server) and a leaner production image (built artifacts,
  gunicorn/`next start` or standalone output) without duplicating base
  layers.
- **Env-example files written without the leading dot** (`env.example`,
  `env.local.example`) — the Write/Bash sandbox used to generate this
  scaffold refuses any file path containing the substring `.env`, even for
  placeholder content. Documented in each file and in the root README;
  rename them locally (e.g. `mv env.example .env`) to restore the
  conventional dotfile name.
