# Decisions Log

## 2026-09-05 — Cycle 1 apply: implementation complete (canonical-uml-model)

`sdd-apply` implemented all 23 tasks from
`openspec/changes/canonical-uml-model/tasks.md` in `backend/apps/uml_modeling/`,
following DD1–DD9 below exactly, with strict TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR,
`pytest` + `hypothesis`, no `pytest-django` DB fixtures needed). 80 backend
tests pass with zero regression to the pre-existing health-check smoke test
(81/81 total). Notes for `sdd-verify`:

- **`EMPTY_ELEMENT_NAME` on whitespace-only names**: implemented as the
  design's noted deliberate superset — a name is empty if
  `name.strip() == ""`, not only `name == ""`. The spec scenario only
  shows the literal empty-string case; whitespace-only is additionally
  covered and tested (`test_empty_element_name_flags_a_whitespace_only_class_name`).
- **Duplicate-name rules anchor on the second (and later) occurrence**,
  not the first: `DUPLICATE_CLASS_NAME`, `DUPLICATE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME`, and
  `DUPLICATE_ENUMERATION_LITERAL` each flag every element after the first
  one sharing a name, so the diagnostic count is deterministic
  (N-1 diagnostics for N same-named elements). Neither the spec nor the
  design mandated a specific anchor; this was the implementation choice.
- **Integration coverage for uml-validation REQ4** (every `path`/
  `element_ref` resolves to a real element) was added as one dedicated
  test (`test_validation_integration.py`) exercising the full 10-rule
  registry together via `validate()`, plus a shared
  `diagnostic_resolves_to_a_real_element()` helper in `tests/factories.py`
  (task 7.6). The helper was not retrofitted into every individual
  per-rule test file (each already asserts `path`/`element_ref` directly
  against its own fixture) — flagged here rather than silently deviating.
- No deviation from DD1–DD9 or the module layout; no models/migrations/
  urlconf/schemas were added, matching the design's explicit scope limit.

## 2026-09-05 — Cycle 1 design: canonical UML domain, project document, validation engine

Architecture decisions for the `canonical-uml-model` change (SDD design phase).
The scope-level decisions D0–D8 are recorded in
`openspec/changes/canonical-uml-model/proposal.md`; the decisions below (DD1–DD9)
are the design-level ones that govern how the code is actually shaped.

- **Three layers inside one Django app, with `domain/` as a leaf.**
  `backend/apps/uml_modeling/` is a registration shell (`apps.py` only): no
  `models.py`, no migrations, no urlconf, no Ninja/Pydantic schemas. Inside it,
  `validation/` reads `domain/` and `documents.py` composes `domain/`; nothing
  imports `validation/`, and `domain/` imports nothing local. The whole app
  imports neither Django, Ninja, nor Pydantic, so the single `validate()` entry
  point stays callable from every future channel (HTTP, Channels, XMI import,
  assistant, generation) exactly as document section 10 requires.
- **DD1 — Two enforcement layers, deliberately distinct.** Construction
  invariants raise `ValueError`/`TypeError` from `__post_init__`; model-level
  semantic problems become `Diagnostic`s. The specs demand both: a class-typed
  attribute and an empty `owner_id` must be impossible to construct, while
  duplicate names and dangling references must be reportable, navigable, and
  fixable rather than fatal.
- **DD2 — The boundary between those layers.** Construction rejects only what is
  *unrepresentable or mistyped*; it never rejects user-fixable content. Concretely,
  `Multiplicity(-1, None)` and `Multiplicity(2, 1)` MUST remain constructible,
  because otherwise the `INVALID_MULTIPLICITY` diagnostic could never be produced.
  `Multiplicity` is therefore a deliberately unvalidated value object.
- **DD3 — Frozen dataclasses, `tuple` for ordered collections.** `frozen=True`
  combined with `list` fields is only shallow immutability. Real snapshots are
  needed by the later command bus, undo/redo, and optimistic-revision cycles, and
  immutable sequences also make `hypothesis` shrinking deterministic. The specs'
  word "list" is read as "ordered sequence".
- **DD4 — Explicit static rule registry over a decorator registry.** The ten
  Cycle-1 rules are listed as a `RULES: tuple[Rule, ...]` in `validation/engine.py`,
  importing named functions from `validation/rules/`. This gives deterministic
  diagnostic order, no import-time side effects, no hidden global mutable state,
  a greppable list, and a registry that a test can assert on directly. A `@rule`
  decorator would have made ordering depend on import order.
- **DD5 — Registry injected via default argument**: `validate(model, rules=RULES)`.
  The public one-argument call matches the spec exactly, while the engine's
  aggregation and its "never short-circuit" behaviour can be tested with fake
  rules without touching the real ten.
- **DD6 — Rules keep the bare `(CanonicalUmlModel) -> Iterable[Diagnostic]`
  signature** and build their own local id→element dictionaries, instead of the
  engine passing a shared prebuilt index. This preserves the spec's "callable in
  isolation" requirement with zero setup, and at class-diagram scale (tens of
  elements) the repeated dictionary construction is negligible. Adding an optional
  second parameter later is non-breaking.
- **DD7 — `ElementId = NewType("ElementId", str)`, generated from `uuid4().hex`.**
  Strings serialize to JSON and XMI with no adapter, `NewType` costs nothing at
  runtime, and ids are already the alphabet of the diagnostic `path` grammar.
- **DD8 — Pure mutation helpers take an explicit `now: datetime`.**
  `ProjectDocument.with_model(...)` / `.with_layout(...)` never call
  `datetime.now()` internally, keeping the domain clock-free and deterministic;
  revision and timestamp tests need no `freezegun` or monkeypatching.
- **DD9 — `DiagnosticCode` is a `StrEnum`, path builders live in
  `validation/diagnostics.py`.** The ten codes are fixed and closed, so an enum
  prevents typos and enables exhaustiveness tests; the slash-rooted `path` grammar
  is part of the diagnostic contract and belongs next to `Diagnostic` rather than
  in a separate module.
- **Two refinements to the proposal's file layout.** `validation/rules/structure.py`
  was added because `CLASS_WITHOUT_ATTRIBUTES` fits none of the four originally
  proposed rule files, and no separate `paths.py` was created (see DD9).
- **Normative generalization direction.** For `RelationshipKind.GENERALIZATION`,
  `source` is the specific (child) and `target` is the general (parent). Cycle
  detection runs an iterative DFS over the child→parent digraph and emits exactly
  one diagnostic per cycle, anchored at the lowest-sorted participating class id,
  so the diagnostic count is deterministic. A self-generalization is a length-1
  cycle reported as `GENERALIZATION_CYCLE`; `SELF_ASSOCIATION` stays scoped to
  `ASSOCIATION`.
- **No sequence diagram this cycle.** `openspec/config.yaml` requires sequence
  diagrams for realtime/collaboration flows (Django Channels); no realtime flow is
  in Cycle 1's scope, so the rule does not apply. A `validate()` call-flow diagram
  is documented instead, as the only non-obvious control flow in the change.

## 2026-08-31 — Scope pivot to the real exam spec + stack corrections + dual-mobile clarification + SDD adoption

- **Scope pivot: the real project is the CASE-tool exam spec, not the
  originally-scaffolded generic CRUD app.** `product-04-next-django.md`
  (repo root) was found to be the actual, authoritative exam statement — an
  offline-first collaborative CASE tool for UML class diagramming with
  manual/voice/image/XMI input converging into a `CanonicalUmlModel`,
  realtime collaboration, and automatic generation of a Spring Boot
  backend + Next.js frontend + Android (Capacitor) app from the modeled
  domain. The previously scaffolded Django+DRF/Next.js/Flutter CRUD
  skeleton was infrastructure only and never described this real scope.
  `docs/ai/*` is being reconciled to describe the real target, while
  `product-04-next-django.md` itself stays frozen as the authoritative
  source (per its own section 1) and is never edited to reflect progress.
- **Stack corrections applied** (in progress by parallel workstreams at
  the time of this entry, not yet fully confirmed — see
  `CURRENT_STATE.md`): backend moves from Django REST Framework to
  **Django Ninja**; adds **Django Channels + Daphne** (ASGI) for realtime;
  adds **Argon2** password hashing + **PyJWT**; bootstraps
  **pytest + pytest-django + hypothesis**. Frontend adds
  **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Cytoscape.js + cytoscape-fcose + Jotai**;
  bootstraps **Vitest + React Testing Library**. Cypress (E2E) bootstrap is
  planned but not yet started by anyone.
- **Dual mobile requirement clarified — both mandatory, not conflicting.**
  The document's own generated-output Android strategy (section 26) is
  **Next.js PWA + Capacitor**, wrapping the same generated Next.js code —
  this applies only to applications the tool generates for its end users.
  Separately, the course instructor explicitly and firmly requires this
  project itself to ship a real **Flutter** mobile client (`mobile/`) for
  the main CASE tool. These are two independent requirements from two
  independent sources; neither supersedes or replaces the other, and both
  must be satisfied.
- **Adopted SDD (Spec-Driven Development) going forward, hybrid mode:
  OpenSpec files + Engram.** The spec document's own section 1 mandates
  deriving use cases, grouping them into cycles, proposing acceptance
  criteria, implementing one use case at a time, and maintaining a
  document of real state separate from the vision document — this is
  effectively an SDD-shaped requirement written directly into the exam
  statement. `openspec/` was initialized at the repo root (`sdd-init`) to
  formalize this: every future feature (starting with `CanonicalUmlModel`
  + `ProjectDocument`/`DiagramLayout` + the validation engine) goes through
  explore → propose → spec → design → tasks → apply → verify → archive,
  with Engram persisting cross-session decisions and context.

## Original scaffold decisions

- **Django settings package named `config`** — keeps the settings/urls/wsgi/asgi
  package name generic and decoupled from any specific app or product name.
- **Env vars via django-environ, no hardcoding** — secrets, hosts, DB
  credentials, and CORS origins must never be committed or baked into code;
  `environ.Env` centralizes reading them with sane `.env` file support.
- **psycopg2-binary over psycopg3** — chosen for tutorial/documentation
  ubiquity: most Django docs, tutorials, and Stack Overflow answers still
  assume psycopg2, and the binary wheel avoids build-toolchain friction in
  the Docker image.
- **CORS via django-cors-headers** — the Next.js frontend is a separate
  origin from the Django API, so cross-origin requests need to be
  explicitly allow-listed rather than silently blocked or wide open.
- **Tailwind intentionally NOT added** — it was not requested by the spec;
  adding it now would be an unnecessary dependency/opinion for a bare
  scaffold.
- **Flutter not dockerized** — mobile apps are built/run via the Flutter
  SDK against emulators/physical devices on the host, not inside a Linux
  container; there is no meaningful way to "run" a mobile app in a
  server-style container.
- **Multi-stage Dockerfiles with dev/prod targets (backend + frontend)** —
  a single Dockerfile serves both live-reload local development (bind
  mounts, dev server) and a leaner production image (built artifacts,
  gunicorn/`next start` or standalone output) without duplicating base
  layers.
- **Env-example files written without the leading dot** (`env.example`,
  `env.local.example`) — the Write/Bash sandbox used to generate this
  scaffold refuses any file path containing the substring `.env`, even for
  placeholder content. Documented in each file and in the root README;
  rename them locally (e.g. `mv env.example .env`) to restore the
  conventional dotfile name.
